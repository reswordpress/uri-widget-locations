# URI Widget Locations

Adds a field for URLs to each widget.  Widgets then only display when the URL of the page matches the URL of the widget.

To match the front page, use a special keyword:  
```
<front>
```

Otherwise, enter the URL that the widget should be displayed on.  Like so:  
```
/article/foo-bar
```

The widget accepts as many URLs to match as you'd like, listed on new lines.  e.g.  
```
/article/foo-bar
/article/foo-bar-baz
/article/foo
```

Asterisks can be used as wild card characters.  For example, to display a widget on all URLs that begin with /article use:
```
/article/*
```

It's also possible to exclude URLs. If you'd like to display the widget on articles, but not on the article index/category/archive pages, you can prefix the pattern with an exclamation point:
```
/article/*
!/article/page/*
```

Note: the exclusion logic is performed **after** the matching logic.
